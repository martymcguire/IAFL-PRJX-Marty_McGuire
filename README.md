# Example Project Repository

This is an example repository for project documentation for the MICA IA FabLab Class, Fall 2014 edition.

Each project should include:

* A README.md file in Markdown format describing the project requirements.
* A brief PDF document (~200 words) describing what your project is about, how it works, techniques you used, issues to dealt with, etc.
* A `source/` folder containing the source design file(s) (OpenSCAD, etc.) for your project.
* An `export/` folder containing the ready-to-print STL files you used for your project. This is not required for laser cut projects.
* An `images/` folder containing **photos** of your finished form.
* A brief video of your finished project in action, if it has any interactive elements.
* A `LICENSE` file describing the license under which others may reuse your work for this project.

Each project belongs in its own repository with a naming convention like:

`IAFL-PRJ#-Firstname_Lastname`

Leaving out any component or deviating widely from this format will cost you points.
